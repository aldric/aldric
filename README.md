## 🏗️ Architectural Philosophy
I architect resilient digital ecosystems through **Edge-Native Performance** and **Observability-Driven Development**. My professional work is private; these blueprints codify my standards:

- 📜 **[Governance & ADRs](https://gist.github.com/aldric/b2f62a25f85da69ae5361ec96d68f10e):** Standardizing decision-making for high-scale platforms.
- 🤖 **[Edge-AI RAG](https://gist.github.com/aldric/e80fe8aa124cff37778e667d6115baab):** Private, low-latency AI automation via Cloudflare Workers.
- 🌐 **[Fleet Management](https://gist.github.com/aldric/f679ea513c7de45731a751e288e028f0):** Global routing and caching for 12,000+ domains.
- 🔐 **[Zero Trust IaC](https://gist.github.com/aldric/adf74f6de13d1fac75536ccdfb3a4223):** Automating identity-aware security and Cloudflare Access via Terraform.
- 📡 **[OTel Framework](https://gist.github.com/aldric/98e583c61fcc3efbf0284e17bde2c957):** Unified observability to reduce MTTR in distributed systems.
- 🛡️ **[Data Pipelines](https://gist.github.com/aldric/1cd49a1be73a2800803045a4d082b28b):** batch & streaming ingestion for high-scale performance marketing and analytics.
